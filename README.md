# NTD-Public-Transit-Improvement-using-GCP

## Overview

This project is a pioneering venture to enhance public transport systems using Google Cloud Platform's powerful data analytics capabilities. We aim to navigate through extensive datasets, uncovering insights that can optimize transit routes, improve vehicle allocation, and ensure a sustainable, eco-friendly approach to urban transportation.

## Goals

- **Accessibility Optimization**: To use data analytics to ensure convenient access to public transit vehicles for everyone.
- **Resource Allocation**: Efficient management of the scarcity of transit resources through informed decision-making.
- **Passenger Comfort & Safety**: Enhance travel experience by analyzing data related to comfort and safety.
- **Environmental Responsibility**: Reduce the carbon footprint of public transit by leveraging eco-friendly technologies.

## GCP Technology Stack

- **Open Refine**: Data cleaning and preparation.
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: Secure data storage and management.
- **Dataproc Hadoop Cluster**: Scalable processing for batch querying and streaming.
- **BigQuery**: Data warehouse for analytics with SQL-like capabilities.
- **Hive & Spark**: Data processing tools for handling large datasets and performing complex queries.

## Data Lifecycle Management

Our workflow starts with data refinement using Open Refine, progresses to secure storage in GCS, and utilizes Dataproc alongside Hive and Spark for analysis. This ensures high-quality data is ready for multidimensional analysis.

## Dataset

We leverage the National Transit Database (NTD) dataset, containing detailed vehicle data for each transit agency, including age distribution, lifetime mileage, and service fleet composition.
